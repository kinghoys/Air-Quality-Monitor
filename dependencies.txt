Here are the `npm` commands to install all the dependencies used in the current state of your Air Quality Monitor app frontend, based on the cleaned-up list without unused dependencies:

### Production Dependencies
Run these commands in your terminal at the project root (e.g., `D:\air-quality-app\air-quality-monitor`):

```bash
npm create-react-app air-quality-monitor

npm install chart.js@^4.4.8
npm install framer-motion@^12.4.7
npm install react@^18.3.1
npm install react-dom@^18.3.1
npm install react-chartjs-2@^5.3.0
npm install styled-components@^6.1.15
npm install react-feather@^2.0.10
npm install @nivo/line@^0.94.0
npm install @nivo/pie@^0.94.0
```

### Optional: Install All at Once
If you prefer a single command:

```bash
npm install chart.js@^4.4.8 framer-motion@^12.4.7 react@^18.3.1 react-dom@^18.3.1 react-chartjs-2@^5.3.0 styled-components@^6.1.15 react-feather@^2.0.10 @nivo/line@^0.94.0 @nivo/pie@^0.94.0
```

### Notes
- No development dependencies are currently required since `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, and `tailwindcss` were unused and removed.
- If you kept testing libraries or other dependencies, let me know, and I'll add those commands too!

Let me know if you need commands for additional modifications!
